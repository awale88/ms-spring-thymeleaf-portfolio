# Portfolio Website
## Overview

This project demonstrates my personal portfolio website using Spring Boot Application. I used static HTML, CSS,
JS and Bootstrap Template for front-end. I've hosted my website on Railway.app platform integrating PostgresSQL to save the data into the database.
Utilizing Spring Data JPA to persist the data for CRUD operation into the database.Integrated common 
libraries like Project Lombok to reduce the boiler code. 

Used  Spring Thymeleaf to render the static page and UI. Implemented the Email SMTP to send email to the subscriber.
Validated input data using Jakarta-X for validation. Also, used Dev-tools to test/develop/deploy my website efficiently.
